# Plan Command

This command creates a comprehensive implementation plan before writing any code.

Run inline by default. Do not call the Task tool or any subagent by default.

## What This Command Does

1. **Restate Requirements** - Clarify what needs to be built
2. **Identify Risks** - Surface potential issues and blockers
3. **Create Step Plan** - Break down implementation into phases
4. **Wait for Confirmation** - MUST receive user approval before proceeding

## How It Works

The assistant will:

1. **Analyze the request** and restate requirements in clear terms
2. **Ground the plan** in relevant codebase patterns when the repo is available
3. **Break down into phases** with specific, actionable steps
4. **Identify dependencies** between components
5. **Assess risks** and potential blockers
6. **Estimate complexity** (High/Medium/Low)
7. **Present the plan** and WAIT for your explicit confirmation

## Pattern Grounding

Before writing the plan, search the codebase for conventions the implementation should mirror:

| Category | What to capture |
|---|---|
| Naming | File, function, type, command, or script naming in the affected area |
| Error handling | How failures are raised, returned, logged, or handled gracefully |
| Data access | Repository, service, query, or filesystem patterns |
| Tests | Test file location, framework, fixtures, and assertion style |

If no similar code exists, state that explicitly. Do not invent a pattern.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {Feature Name}

**Complexity**: {Small | Medium | Large}

## Summary
{2-3 sentences}

## Patterns to Mirror
| Category | Source | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Naming | `path:line` | {short description} |
| Errors | `path:line` | {short description} |

## Files to Change
| File | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `path` | CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE | {reason} |

## Tasks
### Task 1: {name}
- **Action**: {what to do}
- **Mirror**: {pattern to follow}
- **Validate**: {command that proves correctness}

## Risks
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|

## Acceptance
- [ ] All tasks complete
- [ ] Patterns mirrored, not reinvented
```

After presenting the plan, WAIT for confirmation before writing code.

## Important Notes

**CRITICAL**: This command will **NOT** write any code until you explicitly confirm the plan with "yes" or "proceed" or similar affirmative response.

If you want changes, respond with:
- "modify: [your changes]"
- "different approach: [alternative]"
- "skip phase 2 and do phase 3 first"

## Integration with Other Commands

After planning:
- Use `/build-fix` if build errors occur
- Use `/code-review` to review completed implementation
- Use `/pr` to open a pull request
